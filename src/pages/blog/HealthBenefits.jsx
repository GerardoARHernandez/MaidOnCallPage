            <p className="py-3">We always try to keep our home clean, but some days we unconsciously wonder: What would be wrong if I put cleaning my house aside and took a break?</p>

            <p className="py-3">How important is a clean house? To answer that, today we will share just a few of the many ways that keeping a clean home can benefit your health and the health of your loved ones. more than one sure you will surprise.</p>

            <h2 className="py-4 text-2xl font-semibold">1.- Keeping your bedroom clean can help you rest better, having a higher quality sleep</h2>
            <p className="py-2">US National Sleep Foundation showed that 45% of Americans sleep poorly. With our stressful and on-the-go lifestyle, it becomes difficult to fall asleep.</p>
            <p className="py-2">The truth is that our minds are full of information and stimuli, leading to poorer sleep quality. These facts cause us to think about all the things we leave undone while trying to fall asleep, including all the clutter that surrounds us in our bedrooms.</p>
            <p className="py-2">The National Sleep Foundation also conducted a survey that clearly showed that those with clean sheets and rooms had an easier time falling asleep.<br></br>
            Clean bedroom, clean mind!</p>

            <h2 className="py-4 text-2xl font-semibold">2.- A clean and clutter-free space can improve your mental health</h2>
            <p className="py-2">When all surfaces are covered in clutter or clothing is found to be out of place with dirt, dust, or pet hair, it gives us a feeling of internal discomfort.</p>
            <p className="py-2">It’s overwhelming and can actually contribute to stress, anxiety and even depression believe it or not. While parts of our brain shut down clutter over time and become “clutter blind”, other parts of our brain become stressed. Everything you see is disproportionate then. A Princeton University study concluded that clutter could stress the visual cortex, making it difficult to process tasks that should be done.</p>
            <p className="py-2">There have been many psychological studies that show that a tidy and clean space can help us to concentrate better and feel calmer. It helps us to reduce the feeling of feeling depressed, as well as help us to mitigate anxiety in general.</p>

            <h2 className="py-4 text-2xl font-semibold">3.- A clean home helps us choose to eat healthier foods</h2>
            <p className="py-2">As we have discussed, messy, dirty, and even smelly spaces make us feel anxious and stressed. If we’re being honest with ourselves, it’s no secret that many of us tend to make poor food choices when stressed.</p>
            <p className="py-2">When you look at it this way and raise it, it is easy to understand that our habits will also be if the opposite occurs in the environment. A clean and tidy home can lead to better eating habits and an overall healthier lifestyle.</p>
            <p className="py-2">It is no fun cooking or eating in a messy, dirty kitchen, so those with cleaner, tidier kitchens are more likely to prepare healthier food at home, rather than avoiding their kitchens altogether and eating out instead.</p>

            <h2 className="py-4 text-2xl font-semibold">4.- A clean home can relieve seasonal allergy symptoms</h2>
            <p className="py-2">Whether you have seasonal, outdoor, pollen and mould allergies or what is considered “indoor” allergies like dust, dust mites, pet dander or hair, keeping a clean home can reduce your symptoms.</p>
            <p className="py-2">If allowed to accumulate, dust, pet hair, and other allergens can wreak havoc on your nose and eyes among others, leaving you feeling foggy, itchy, and red-eyed.</p>
            <p className="py-2">Vacuuming regularly with a powered vacuum will help, and paying special attention to any areas that may be prone to mould growth, specifically in the bathroom. We must keep the dust in the air as little as possible, removing it with a damp cloth. Unlike a dry cloth, which will simply send dust into the air. Regularly changing bedding and cleaning window decorations can greatly reduce allergy symptoms.</p>

            <h2 className="py-4 text-2xl font-semibold">5.- A constantly clean and tidy home saves money</h2>
            <p className="py-2">Staying on top of regular cleaning tasks and maintaining order can save you money in several ways.</p>
            <p className="py-2">Extra-strength, more expensive specialty cleaners. Dirt and grime don’t have a chance to build up to the point where more cleaning power is required.</p>
            <p className="py-2">Second, surfaces are more likely to be damaged if they are covered in dirt and grime. Dirt on hardwood or tile floors acts like sandpaper when people walk on them, scratching and dulling the finish, making it look worn sooner than it should. Hard water and soap deposits can damage bathroom finishes. Keeping surfaces like floors, countertops, and bathroom fixtures clean will help keep them looking newer for longer.</p>
            <p className="py-2">Third, keeping appliances clean will help them run more efficiently and last longer, saving you thousands of dollars.</p>
